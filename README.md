# Book Review Service - Backend Engineer Technical Assessment

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Book Review Service application built as a technical assessment for a Backend Engineer position. The project demonstrates advanced backend concepts through a modern web application that allows users to manage books and reviews with a robust, scalable architecture.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The Book Review Service addresses key backend engineering challenges:
- **RESTful API Design** - Clean, scalable endpoint architecture
- **Data Modeling** - Relational data structures with proper normalization
- **Caching Strategy** - Multi-layer caching with TTL and invalidation
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
- **Testing Architecture** - Structure ready for automated testing suites

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### API Design & Integration

**RESTful Endpoints Implemented:**
```
GET /books                     - List all books with pagination
POST /books                    - Create a new book
GET /books/{id}/reviews        - Get reviews for a specific book
POST /books/{id}/reviews       - Add a review to a book
```

**Key Features:**
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Proper HTTP status codes and response formatting
- Consistent API response structure with success/error states
- Request validation and sanitization
- Mock network delays for realistic testing

### Data Modeling

**Entity Relationship Design:**
```
Book (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (Many) Review (Many) ‚Üê‚Üí (1) User
```

**Book Entity:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `title` - Book title (required)
- `author` - Author name (required)
- `isbn` - ISBN number (optional)
- `publishedYear` - Publication year
- `genre` - Book category
- `description` - Book summary
- `coverImage` - Cover image URL
- `createdAt` / `updatedAt` - Timestamps

**Review Entity:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `bookId` - Foreign key to Book
- `userId` - Foreign key to User
- `rating` - 1-5 star rating
- `title` - Review title
- `content` - Review content
- `createdAt` / `updatedAt` - Timestamps

**User Entity:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - User display name
- `email` - User email
- `avatar` - Profile image URL

### Storage & Caching Strategy

**Two-Layer Storage Architecture:**

1. **Primary Storage (LocalStorage)**
   - Persistent data storage in browser
   - Automatic initialization with seed data
   - Data integrity with error handling
   - JSON serialization/deserialization

2. **Caching Layer (In-Memory)**
   - Redis-like interface with TTL support
   - Cache hit/miss/expired logging
   - Automatic cache invalidation on data changes
   - Performance optimization for repeated queries

**Cache Implementation:**
```typescript
// Cache with TTL expiration
cache.set(key, data, 300000); // 5 minutes TTL
const cachedData = cache.get(key); // Returns null if expired
cache.delete(key); // Manual invalidation
```

### Error Handling & Resilience

**Multi-Level Error Strategy:**

1. **API Level**
   - Try-catch blocks with proper error propagation
   - Graceful degradation on service failures
   - Simulated network errors for testing (5% error rate)
   - Detailed error logging and monitoring

2. **Application Level**
   - React Error Boundaries for component failures
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Fallback UI states

3. **Data Level**
   - LocalStorage error handling
   - Data validation and sanitization
   - Backup/restore mechanisms
   - Cache fallback strategies

### Automated Testing Architecture

**Testing Strategy Preparation:**
- Component isolation for unit testing
- Mock API services for integration testing
- Error simulation for resilience testing
- Performance testing hooks
- Data fixtures and test utilities

**Test Categories Supported:**
- Unit Tests (Jest/Vitest ready)
- Integration Tests (API endpoint testing)
- E2E Tests (User journey testing)
- Performance Tests (Load testing capabilities)
- Error Handling Tests (Failure scenarios)
